@inproceedings{Donini91tableau,
	Abstract = {A basic feature of Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems is to represent knowledge by means of taxonomies, here called terminologies, and to provide a specialized reasoning engine to do inferences on these structures. The taxonomy is built through a representation language called aconcept language(ordescription logic), which is given a well-defined set-theoretic semantics. The efficiency of reasoning has often been advocated as a primary motivation for the use of such systems. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) a complexity analysis of concept satisfiability and subsumption for a wide class of concept languages; (2) algorithms for these inferences that comply with the worst-case complexity of the reasoning task they perform. },

@article{Nebel90intractable,
	Abstract = {Computational tractability has been a major concern in the area of terminological knowledge representation and reasoning. However, all analyses of the computational complexity of terminological reasoning are based on the hidden assumption that subsumption in terminologies reduces to subsumption of concept descriptions without a significant increase in computational complexity. In this paper it will be shown that this assumption, which seems to work in the ``normal case,'' is nevertheless wrong. Subsumption in terminologies turns out to be co-NP-complete for a minimal terminological representation language that is a subset of every useful terminological language. },

@article{bidoit91default,
	Abstract = {The default approach to the theory of logic programs (and deductive databases) is based on the interpretation of negation by default rules. Default logic is a well-suited formalism to express the Closed World Assumption and to define the declarative semantics of stratifiable logic programs. The case of disjunctive consequences in rules is treated. General logic programs may not have a meaning with respect to default semantics. The contribution of the paper is to exhibit an interesting class of programs having a default semantics, called effectively stratifiable programs. This time, disjunctive consequences are not considered. Effective stratification is a weaker constraint than stratification, local stratification and weak stratification. Besides enlarging the class of stratifiable logic programs, the paper contributes to provide a constructive definition of well-founded models of logic programs. The class of effectively stratifiable logic programs matches the class of programs having a total well-founded model and in general, the default semantics extends the well-founded semantics.},

@article{codd82practical,
	Abstract = {It is well known that the growth in demands from end users for new applications is outstripping the capability of data processing departments to implement the corresponding application programs. There are two complementary approaches to attacking this problem land both approaches are needed): one is to put end users into direct touch with the information stored in computers; the other is to increase the productivity of data processing professionals in the development of application programs. It is less well known that a single technology, relational database management, provides a practical foundation for both approaches. It is explained why this is so. 
While developing this productivity theme, it is noted that the time has come to draw a very sharp line between relational and nonrelational database systems, so that the label "relational" will not be used in misleading ways. The key to drawing this line is something called a "relational processing capability."},

@inproceedings{herald-sqo,
	Abstract = {Data stream management systems (DSMS) processing long-running queries over large volumes of stream data must typically deliver time-critical responses. We propose the first semantic query optimization (SQO) approach that utilizes dynamic substream metadata at runtime to find a more efficient query plan than the one selected at compilation time. We identify four SQO techniques guaranteed to result in performance gains. Based on classic satisfiability theory we then design a lightweight query optimization algorithm that efficiently detects SQO opportunities at runtime. At the logical level, our algorithm instantiates multiple concurrent SQO plans, each processing different partially overlapping substreams. Our novel execution paradigm employs multi-modal operators to support the execution of these concurrent SQO logical plans in a single physical plan. This highly agile execution strategy reduces resource utilization while supporting lightweight adaptivity. Our extensive experimental study in the CAPE stream processing system using both synthetic and real data confirms that our optimization techniques significantly reduce query execution times, up to 60%, compared to the traditional approach.},

@inproceedings{hashedSnapshots,
	Abstract = {Sliding window equijoins are commonly used in data stream applications. In their implementation, a hash table is generally allocated for each stream source. However, this structure may degrade join performance because all tuples in the hash tables need to be scanned to find expired tuples whenever windows are updated periodically. This paper presents an alternative structure to improve the performance of sliding window equijoins. The basic idea of the proposed method is to allocate a hash table for each set of tuples arriving for a window slide interval. This organization facilitates the identification of expired tuples and improves the join performance, which we observed through our experimental results.},

We introduce a unit-time-basis cost model to analyze the expected performance of these algorithms. Using this cost model, we propose strategies for maximizing the efficiency of processing joins in three scenarios. First, we consider the case where one stream is much faster than the other. We show that asymmetric combinations of join algorithms, (e.g., hash join on one input, nested-loops join on the other) can outperform symmetric join algorithm implementations. Second, we investigate the case where system resources are insufficient to keep up with the input streams. We show that we can maximize the number of join result tuples produced in this case by properly allocating computing resources across the two input streams. Finally, we investigate strategies for maximizing the number of result tuples produced when memory is limited, and show that proper memory allocation across the two input streams can result in significantly lower resource usage and/or more result tuples produced.},

@inproceedings{parallel-joins,
	Abstract = {The number of stream-based information sources is increasing, so query processing on streams is getting more important. Window-join is one of typical operations for stream data processing. It uses sliding-windows to keep recent input tuples, and generate the join result from the tuples in the window. To reduce processing cost of window-join, some parallel window-join algorithms have been proposed in the context of distributed environments. Their main objectives are increasing throughput. They do not concern about reducing processing delay, because delay caused network transfer is unavoidable in distributed environments. In our research, we focus on reducing processing delay of window-join by using multi-core environments instead of distributed environments. We propose and evaluate two parallel window-join algorithms for multiple input streams. The first one is Parallel Tree-based Join, which makes multiple cores execute multiple join trees with different join orders. Each join tree is optimized to minimize processing delay for tuples from one stream. Another is Parallel MJoin, which is an extension of existing MJoin algorithm. Parallel MJoin concurrently performs multiple probe processes instead of sequential probe used in original MJoin. This paper also includes experimental evaluation to investigate efficiency of two methods.},

@article{volcano,
	Abstract = {To investigate the interactions of extensibility and parallelism in database query processing, we have developed a new dataflow query execution system called Volcano. The Volcano effort provides a rich environment for research and education in database systems design, heuristics for query optimization, parallel query execution, and resource allocation. Volcano uses a standard interface between algebra operators, allowing easy addition of new operators and operator implementations. Operations on individual items, e.g., predicates, are imported into the query processing operators using support functions. The semantics of support functions is not prescribed; any data type including complex objects and any operation can be realized. Thus, Volcano is extensible with new operators, algorithms, data types, and type-specific methods. Volcano includes two novel meta-operators. The choose-plan meta-operator supports dynamic query evaluation plans that allow delaying selected optimization decisions until run-time, e.g., for embedded queries with free variables. The exchange meta-operator supports intra-operator parallelism on partitioned datasets and both vertical and horizontal inter-operator parallelism, translating between demand-driven dataflow within processes and data-driven dataflow between processes. All operators, with the exception of the exchange operator, have been designed and implemented in a single-process environment, and parallelized using the exchange operator. Even operators not yet designed can be parallelized using this new operator if they use and provide the interator interface. Thus, the issues of data manipulation and parallelism have become orthogonal, making Volcano the first implemented query execution engine that effectively combines extensibility and parallelism},

In particular, one of its tools, the optimizer generator, is discussed. The data model, logical algebra, physical algebra, and optimization rules are translated by the optimizer generator into optimizer source code. It is shown that, compared with the EXODUS optimizer generator prototype, the search engine of the Volcano optimizer generator is more extensible and powerful. It provides effective support for non-trivial cost models and for physical properties such as sorting order. At the same time, it is much more efficient, as it combines dynamic programming with goal-directed searching and branch-and-bound pruning. Compared with other rule-based optimization systems, it provides complete data model independence and more natural extensibility},

@unpublished{streamprovenance-reversemapping,
	Abstract = {Applications that require continuous processing of high-volume data streams have grown in prevalence and importance. These kinds of system often process streaming data in real-time or near real-time and provide instantaneous responses in order to support a precise and on time decision. In such systems it is difficult to know exactly how a particular result is generated. However, such information is extremely important for the validation and veri?cation of stream processing results. Therefore, it is crucial that stream processing systems have a mechanism for tracking provenance - the information pertaining to the process that produced result data - at the level of individual stream elements which we refer to as fine-grained provenance tracking for streams. The traceability of stream processing systems allows for users to validate individual stream elements, to verify the computation that took place and to understand the chain of reasoning that was used in the production of a stream processing result. Several recent solutions to provenance tracking in stream processing systems mainly focus on coarse-grained stream provenance in which the level of granularity for capturing provenance information is not detailed enough to address our problem. This thesis proposes a novel fine-grained provenance solution for streams that exploits a reverse mapping method to precisely capture dependency relationships for every individual stream element. It is also designed to support a stream-specific provenance query mechanism, which performs provenance queries dynamically over streams of provenance assertions without requiring the assertions to be stored persistently. The dissertation makes four major contributions to the state of the art. First is a provenance model for streams that allows for the provenance of individual stream elements to be obtained. Second is a provenance query method which utilizes a reverse mapping method - stream ancestor functions - in order to obtain the provenance of a particular stream processing result. The third contribution is a stream-specific provenance query mechanism that enables provenance queries to be computed on-the-fly without requiring provenance assertions to be stored persistently. The fourth contribution is the performance characteristics of our stream provenance solution. It is shown that the storage overhead for provenance collection can be reduced significantly by using our storage reduction technique and the marginal cost of storage consumption is constant based on the number of input stream events. A 4\% overhead for the persistent provenance approach and a 7\% overhead for the stream-specific query approach are observed as the impact of provenance recording on system performance. In addition, our stream-specific query approach offers low latency processing (0.3 ms per additional component) with reasonable memory consumption.},

They do discuss merging query plans that involve the same declarative joins using different access and join methods into one eddy, but this limits the query to a single, non-branching route per datum, which is not the case in true multi-query routing.

Uses a c- or java-like forloop notation to represent window transitioning: for (init; limit; step)
init is the start of the window (the item furthest in the sequential past), limit is the end of the query (the item in the sequence after which the query will no longer be processed) and step is the amount of sequential items that arrive between query applications.
Then defines a separate window definition per stream within an appropriate window transition: WindowIs(streamName, startingItem, endingItem), where startingItem and endingItem can be defined in terms of the variables in the forloop.},

If a tuple t  is rejected by an operator that is part of a given query, the tuple is marked as no longer valid as an answer to that query. At every routing step, the operator list for each query for which the tuple is still a valid answer is compared to the set of visited operators: if all operators for the query have been visited, output the tuple for that query.  This implies that tuples may be over joined before returning a result (leading to extra data per result and duplicate results in the case of joins with selectivity < 1), e.g. Q1: S1.a = S2.b AND S1.b = S3.a, Q2: S1.a = S2.b AND S4.a = S1.c; tuple route: S1S2 -> S4S1 (satisfies Q2, not yet Q1, so routed further) -> S1S3 (contains data from S4 and would be duplicated with regard to projection of Q1-only data if S4S1 produced more than 1 result)

@article{distIndexQProc,
	Abstract = {Linked Data is becoming the core part of modern Web applications and thus efficient access to structured information expressed in RDF gains paramount importance. A number of efficient local RDF stores exist already, while distributed indexing and distributed query processing over Linked Data with similar efficiency and data management features as known from traditional database and data integration systems are only starting to develop. Distributed approaches will necessarily co-exist with centralized schemes, as data will be owned by different stakeholders who may not want to provide their complete data sets to a central place. Additionally, central / integrated storage may be prohibited for organizational or legal reasons in certain areas. To support decentralized schemes, only a few attempts in this direction exist so far, but they are limited in terms of capabilities and the degree of distribution vs. efficiency, query expressivity, and scalability. To remedy this situation, the approach and proof-of-concept prototype presented in this paper provides a solution for these open challenges. As we argue for widely distributed systems as a possible answer to scalability issues, we first identify and discuss the main challenges and based on this analysis, we propose an approach for efficient and scalable query processing over distributed Linked Data sources, taking into account the latest advances in database technology. Our system is based on a layered architecture that makes use of the advantages of decentralized indexing and query processing approaches, which have been researched and matured over the last decade. Our approach is based on a logical algebra for queries over RDF data and a related physical query algebra to enable optimization, both on the logical and physical layers in query processing. The introduced operators and strategies for processing complex query plans make excessive use of parallelism and other optimization paradigms of distributed query processing. Our query processing framework includes a sophisticated cost model to enable cost-efficient query planning and query execution. We extensively evaluate our approach through an experimental evaluation of a real proof-of-concept deployment, which demonstrates the efficiency, applicability, and correctness of the proposed concepts.},
