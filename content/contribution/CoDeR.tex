\begin{nestedsection}{CoDeR Model for Continuous Deductive Reasoning}{model}
	CoDeR is an abstract model for continuous deductive reasoning over streamed RDF data that expresses the semantics of Continuous Datalog.
	It is composed of a stream-based data model for expressing the streams $S$, $P$ and $N$ of each ${CDP = \{A,S,R\} \vDash \{A',P,N\}}$, and a minimal algebra of stream-to-stream operators for expressing the persistent set of axiomatic rules $A$.
	It casts the problem of applying those rules to streamed RDF data as that of iterative pattern matching, in a manner inspired by the Rete pattern matching algorithm \citep{forgy79}, though it is meant to support any such algorithm rather than prescribing one itself.
